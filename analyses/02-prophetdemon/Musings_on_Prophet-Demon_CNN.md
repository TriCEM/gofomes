# Musings on Prophet-Demon CNN



## Prophet Notes

* Able to have variable dimension size for adjacency matrix image (if we want to allow population size to vary)[]
  * [keras](https://keras.io/api/layers/convolution_layers/convolution2d/): You can use `None` when a dimension has variable size.
* Intuitively, population size is going to have a large effect on CNN training parameters 
* Assumes no variation in other SIR parameters 





## Demon Notes

- Currently closely following helpful code from Chap 17 of Geron: [code](https://www.kaggle.com/code/scratchpad/notebook46503f29e8/edit)
- reach out to network folks for help on making demon make more realistic networks? 
  - prophet input more realistic too?
